        <h2>"Everyday is a Good Day to Workout"</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the EZ Workout Builder! Built due to a need to change the way that workouts are presented, I wanted to give newer gym goers an easier way to find pre made workouts and hit every muscle group effectively. Strewn throughtout every workout are helpful tips and videos to aid in your fitness journey. The workouts are divided into three groups based on perceived difficulty. Choose the one that suits you best. Happy Lifting!</p>
